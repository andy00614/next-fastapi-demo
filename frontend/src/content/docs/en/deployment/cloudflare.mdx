title: Cloudflare Deployment
---
Deploy your Better SaaS application to Cloudflare Workers using OpenNext.js for global edge performance and scalability. This guide covers the complete deployment process from setup to production.

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers provides a serverless platform that runs your application at the edge, closer to your users worldwide. This deployment method offers:

- **Global Edge Network**: Deploy to 300+ locations worldwide
- **Zero Cold Starts**: Instant application startup
- **Cost Effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Built-in CDN**: Static assets served from the edge
- **DDoS Protection**: Enterprise-grade security included

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Cloudflare Workers, ensure you have:

1. **Cloudflare Account**: [Sign up here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have one
2. **Git Repository**: Your project code in a Git repository
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: A hosted PostgreSQL database (Neon, Supabase, or similar)
4. **Domain Name**: Optional, for custom domains

## Worker Size Limits

**Important**: Cloudflare Workers have size limitations:
- **Free Plan**: 3 MiB compressed
- **Paid Plan**: 10 MiB compressed
The build process will show both original and compressed sizes. Only the compressed size matters for the limit.

import { Callout } from '@/components/widget/callout';

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that the current better-saas deployment to Cloudflare has a worker size of 3.5MiB, requiring a paid plan to deploy to Cloudflare.
</Callout>
```
Total Upload: 24109.96 KiB / gzip: 3491.12 KiB
Your Worker has access to the following bindings:
Binding                                                      Resource
env.NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET (better-saas-cache-bucket)      R2 Bucket
env.WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE (better-saas)                      Worker
env.STATIC_ASSETS                                            Assets
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install Wrangler CLI and project dependencies:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory and install dependencies
pnpm install

# Navigate to the project root directory and login to Cloudflare
pnpm wrangler login
```

### 2. Database Setup

#### PostgreSQL Database

Set up a hosted PostgreSQL database:

**Recommended Providers:**
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) - Serverless PostgreSQL
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Open source Firebase alternative

Note your connection string in this format:
```
postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name
```

### 3. R2 Storage Setup

Create an R2 bucket for file storage and caching:

```bash
# Create R2 bucket for file storage
wrangler r2 bucket create better-saas-files

# Create R2 bucket for Next.js cache
wrangler r2 bucket create better-saas-cache-bucket
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

#### Local Development

Copy environment files and configure:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Configure your `.env` file:

```bash
# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-chars
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# File Storage (Cloudflare R2)
R2_BUCKET_NAME=better-saas-files
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key-id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-access-key
R2_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Payment (Stripe)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Local Development

Test your application locally:

```bash
# Execute this command to generate the .open-next directory and start the development server
pnpm run cf:preview

# If you don't want to rebuild on every change, run this command
pnpm run cf:dev
```

### 6. Database Migration

Run database migrations:

```bash
# Generate migration files
pnpm run db:generate

# Apply migrations
pnpm run db:migrate

# Optional: View database in browser
pnpm run db:studio
```

### 7. Environment Variables in Cloudflare

For production environment variables that need encryption, it's recommended to set them via Wrangler commands or the Cloudflare dashboard.

#### Setting Environment Variables via Wrangler Commands:
Use the following commands to store variables as encrypted environment variables:
```
pnpm wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL 
pnpm wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET 
pnpm wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
pnpm wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET 
pnpm wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID 
pnpm wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET 
pnpm wrangler secret put R2_BUCKET_NAME 
pnpm wrangler secret put R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID 
pnpm wrangler secret put R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
pnpm wrangler secret put R2_ENDPOINT 
pnpm wrangler secret put R2_PUBLIC_URL 
pnpm wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY 
pnpm wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET 
pnpm wrangler secret put NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY
pnpm wrangler secret put NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY
pnpm wrangler secret put NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY
pnpm wrangler secret put NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_YEARLY
pnpm wrangler secret put ADMIN_EMAILS
```
**Important Note**: The above commands do not include the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` variable because environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are inlined into the client code at build time. Therefore, in the `cf:deploy` command in `package.json`, you need to change `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production environment domain.

#### Via Dashboard:

Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
Select your account, then navigate to Workers & Pages > Overview.
Select your Worker, click Settings > Environment Variables.
Add variables or encrypted secret variables (Secrets).

### 8. Deploy to Cloudflare
In the command line, navigate to the project root directory and execute the following command to deploy directly from your local machine to Cloudflare:

```bash
pnpm run cf:deploy
```
Note that before executing this command, you need to first log in to Cloudflare via command line and configure environment variables in Cloudflare.

### 9. Custom Domain Setup
1. **Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Visit the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and log in to your account.
   - Select the account and zone associated with your Worker.
2. **Navigate to Workers & Pages**
   - In the left sidebar of the dashboard, click **Workers & Pages**.
   - On the **Overview** page, select the Worker project you want to configure a custom domain for.
3. **Access Domain and Route Settings**
   - On the selected Worker project page, click the **Settings** tab.
   - In the settings page, find the **Domains & Routes** option, click the **Add** button, then select **Custom Domain**.
4. **Enter Custom Domain**
   - In the popup input box, enter the domain or subdomain you want to configure for the Worker (e.g., `example.com` or `sub.example.com`).
   - Ensure you've added this domain or subdomain in Cloudflare's DNS settings and it's managed by Cloudflare (i.e., DNS records point to Cloudflare's nameservers).
5. **Confirm and Add**
   - Click **Add Custom Domain**.
   - Cloudflare will automatically create the necessary DNS records (usually a CNAME record) and issue an SSL/TLS certificate. You don't need to manually configure DNS or certificates.
   - If the domain you're trying to add already has an existing CNAME record, Cloudflare will prompt you to delete it, as custom domains cannot conflict with existing CNAME records.
6. **Wait for DNS Propagation**
   - After adding the custom domain, DNS record and certificate configuration may take a few minutes to 24 hours to take effect (usually quick).
   - You can check the newly created DNS records on the **DNS** page of the dashboard, confirming their status is "Proxied" (orange cloud icon, indicating proxied through Cloudflare).

### 10. Configure Stripe Webhooks

Configure Stripe webhooks for your production domain:

```bash
# Webhook endpoint
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe

# Required events
- customer.subscription.created
- customer.subscription.updated
- customer.subscription.deleted
- invoice.payment_succeeded
- invoice.payment_failed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow

- **Use `pnpm run cf:preview`** to test production builds locally
- **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production

### 2. Database Management

- **Use separate databases** for development and production
- **Run migrations** in a staging environment first
- **Backup your database** before major changes

### 3. Environment Management

- **Never commit** environment variables to Git
- **Use different secrets** for development and production
- **Rotate secrets** regularly for security

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Monitor bundle size** to stay within Worker limits
- **Use dynamic imports** for code splitting
- **Optimize images** and static assets
- **Enable R2 caching** for better performance

### 5. Security

- **Use strong secrets** (minimum 32 characters)
- **Enable HTTPS** for all environments
- **Configure CORS** properly for your domain
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Cloudflare Analytics

Monitor your application performance:

- **Real User Monitoring**: Track user experience metrics
- **Performance Insights**: Identify bottlenecks
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor application errors

### 2. Worker Logs

Enable logging for debugging:

1. Go to your Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to `Logs` → `Real-time Logs`
3. Enable logging to see runtime logs

### 3. Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Global error boundaries** catch React errors
- **API error handling** with proper status codes
- **Database error handling** with retry logic
- **Payment error handling** with user feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Bundle Size Too Large

**Error**: Worker exceeds size limit

**Solutions**:
- Upgrade to Workers Paid plan (10 MiB limit)
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use `pnpm run analyze` to identify large modules

#### 2. Environment Variable Issues

**Error**: Missing environment variables
